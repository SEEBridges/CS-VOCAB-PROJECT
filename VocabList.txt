Posttest loop: This loop places the condition at the end of the loop and if the condition is true the keyword EXIT is used to stop the looping.
User-controlled loop: A loop which is controlled by the user.
Conditional loop: A loop which will continue if and only if said condition is true.
Count-controlled loop: A count-controlled repetition will exit after running a certain number of times.
Initialization expression: An expression which initializes a loop.
Test expression: a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to test its value.
Update expression: An update expression specifies how UpdateItem will modify the attributes of an item
For loop: A control flow statement that iterates a part of the programs multiple times
Control variable: A program variable that is used to regulate the flow of control of the program.
Counter variable: A special type of variable which is used in the loop to count the repetitions or to know about in which repetition we are in.
Running total: The cumulative sum of a value and all previous values in the column.
Sentinel value: A special input value that tests the condition within the while loop.
Accumulator: A variable which is initialized to zero and is incremented in each repetition with different values.
Nested loop: An inner loop that appears in the loop body of another outer  loop.
Continue statement: Breaks one iteration in the loop, if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
Debug: The routine process of locating and removing bugs, errors or abnormalities from programs.
Array:  A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
Length field: A final method, which is applicable for string objects and you can use it to find the number of characters in a string. 
ArrayList: A resizable array, which is present in the java. util package.
Iteration: An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like 
ArrayList and HashSet.
Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
Comment: Not executed by the compiler and is used to provide information .
Class: Like an object constructor or a blueprint for creating objects.
Attribute: Class attributes are variables within a class.
Method: Used to perform certain actions.
Public: An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class.
Private: an access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class.
Access Modifier: controls the access level
Access Specifier: help us to restrict the scope or visibility of a package, class, constructor, methods, variables, or other data members.
Keyword: Reserved words that can’t be used as variables, methods, classes or any other identifiers. 
Programmer-defined name:
Scope: Variables are only accessible inside the region they are created.
Class definition: Is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.
Method definition:A block of code which only runs when it is called.
Semicolon: Used to terminate a statement. 
Punctuation: Help the Java compiler interpret components of Java source code.
Syntax: All the main rules, commands, constructions to write programs that the compiler and computer “understands”.
Statement: Instructions that tell the programming language what to do
Println: Used to print an argument that is passed to it.
Printf: Prints a string on the screen using a “format string” that includes the instructions to mix several strings and produce the final string to be printed on the screen. i






























Boolean: A Java expression that returns a Boolean value, true or false.
Char: The char keyword is a data type that is used to store a single character.
Unicode: Computer systems internally store data in binary representation.
Assignment operator: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables, == operator.
Integer division: Similar to normal division remainder is discarded, / operator.
Unary: The unary operator is an operator that can be used only with an operand. It is used to represent the positive or negative value, increment/decrement the value by 1, and complement a Boolean value.
Binary: Either 1 or 0 to represent true or false.
Ternary: a condensed form of the if-else statement that also returns a value.
Negation operator: The logical NOT, also called logical negation or logical complement) operator reverses the meaning of a condition.
Modulus: Modulo or Remainder Operator returns the remainder of the two numbers after division
Truncate: to trim some digits of a float or double-type number or some characters of a string from the right.
Precedence: Operator precedence specifies the manner in which operands are grouped with operators
Associativity: When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the operators and operands are grouped according to their associativity.
Combined Assignment operators: Provide a shorter syntax for assigning the result of an arithmetic or bitwise operator. They perform the operation on the two operands before assigning the result to the first operand.
Compound operators: An assignment operator is a binary operator that assigns the result of the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
Widening conversion: Widening conversion takes place when two data types are automatically converted, smaller data type to larger.
Narrowing conversion:  When a larger data type is converted to a smaller data type.
Cast operator: Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
Final: When a variable is declared with the final keyword, its value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant.
Named constants: A named constant is like a variable except that
you are required to give an initial value for a named constant where you declare it, and you cannot change its value.
